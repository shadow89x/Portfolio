### 1. üé® OpenAI DALL-E2 Background Image Creation
In this project, I utilized Azure Computer Vision to remove the background from an image. Then, I employed OpenAI's DALL-E2 to regenerate the background, creating a unique combination of AI creativity and practical application.

### 2. üîé Vectorized Image Search with Azure Computer Vision Embeddings
This project leverages Azure Computer Vision Embeddings to identify the image with the closest resemblance. It also enables a combined search based on both image and text.

### 3. ü©∫ KMeans clustering of medical documents
This project involves transforming PDF files, preprocessing, and extracting text from images. Then, it finds the optimal cluster size and clusters the documents using KMeans clustering.
